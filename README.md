Here is a list of various Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) patterns along with short descriptions:

**[Singleton Pattern](https://github.com/antonykiev/Design-Patterns/blob/master/src/main/kotlin/creational/Singleton.kt)**:
        Description: Ensures a class has only one instance and provides a global point of access to it.

**[Factory Method Pattern](https://github.com/antonykiev/Design-Patterns/blob/master/src/main/kotlin/creational/Factory.kt)**:
        Description: Defines an interface for creating an object but allows subclasses to alter the type of objects that will be created.

**[Abstract Factory Pattern](https://github.com/antonykiev/Design-Patterns/blob/master/src/main/kotlin/creational/AbstractFactory.kt):**
        Description: Provides an interface to create families of related or dependent objects without specifying their concrete classes.

**[Builder Pattern](https://github.com/antonykiev/Design-Patterns/blob/master/src/main/kotlin/creational/Builder.kt):**
        Description: Separates the construction of a complex object from its representation, allowing the same construction process to create different representations.

**[Prototype Pattern](https://github.com/antonykiev/Design-Patterns/blob/master/src/main/kotlin/creational/Prototype.kt):**
        Description: Creates new objects by copying an existing object, known as the prototype, through cloning.

**[Adapter Pattern](https://github.com/antonykiev/Design-Patterns/blob/master/src/main/kotlin/structual/Adapter.kt):**
        Description: Allows incompatible interfaces to work together by wrapping an interface around an existing class.

**[Decorator Pattern](https://github.com/antonykiev/Design-Patterns/blob/master/src/main/kotlin/structual/Decorator.kt):**
        Description: Dynamically adds behavior to objects without altering their structure by wrapping them with new classes that contain the additional behavior.

**[Composite Pattern](https://github.com/antonykiev/Design-Patterns/blob/master/src/main/kotlin/structual/Composite.kt):**
        Description: Composes objects into tree structures to represent part-whole hierarchies, allowing clients to treat individual objects and compositions uniformly.

**[Proxy Pattern](https://github.com/antonykiev/Design-Patterns/blob/master/src/main/kotlin/structual/Proxy.kt):**
        Description: Controls access to an object by providing a surrogate or placeholder for it, allowing additional functionality such as security checks, lazy initialization, etc.

**[Observer Pattern](https://github.com/antonykiev/Design-Patterns/blob/master/src/main/kotlin/beahavioural/Observer.kt):**
        Description: Defines a one-to-many dependency between objects, where if one object changes state, all its dependents are notified and updated automatically.

**[Strategy Pattern](https://github.com/antonykiev/Design-Patterns/blob/master/src/main/kotlin/beahavioural/Strategy.kt):**
        Description: Defines a family of algorithms, encapsulates each one, and makes them interchangeable, allowing the client to choose the algorithm at runtime.

**[Template Method Pattern](https://github.com/antonykiev/Design-Patterns/blob/master/src/main/kotlin/beahavioural/TemplateMethod.kt):**
        Description: Defines the skeleton of an algorithm in a method, deferring some steps to subclasses, allowing them to override certain steps without changing the overall structure of the algorithm.

**[State Pattern](https://github.com/antonykiev/Design-Patterns/blob/master/src/main/kotlin/beahavioural/State.kt):**
        Description: Allows an object to change its behavior when its internal state changes, thus appearing to change its class.

**[Memento Pattern](https://github.com/antonykiev/Design-Patterns/blob/master/src/main/kotlin/beahavioural/Momento.kt):**
        Description: Captures and externalizes an object's internal state so that it can be restored to that state later.

**[Command Pattern](https://github.com/antonykiev/Design-Patterns/blob/master/src/main/kotlin/beahavioural/Command.kt):**
        Description: Encapsulates a request as an object, thereby allowing for parameterization of clients with queues, requests, and operations.

**[Visitor Pattern](https://github.com/antonykiev/Design-Patterns/blob/master/src/main/kotlin/beahavioural/Visitor.kt):**
        Description: Represents an operation to be performed on elements of an object structure without changing their classes.

**[Chain of Responsibility Pattern](https://github.com/antonykiev/Design-Patterns/blob/master/src/main/kotlin/beahavioural/ChainOfResponsibility.kt):**
        Description: Passes a request along a chain of handlers, allowing multiple objects to handle the request without explicitly specifying which object does so.

**[Flyweight Pattern](https://github.com/antonykiev/Design-Patterns/blob/master/src/main/kotlin/structual/FlyWeight.kt):**
        Description: Minimizes memory usage or computational expenses by sharing as much as possible with similar objects.


These patterns represent commonly recurring solutions to specific design problems in object-oriented software development. They aid in creating more maintainable, flexible, and efficient software systems.
